# ggdist 3.1.1

Bug fixes:

* If a string is supplied to the `point_interval` argument of `stat_slabinterval()`,
  a function with that name will be searched for in the calling environment and
  the `ggdist` package environment. The latter ensures that `stat`s work when
  ggdist is loaded but not attached to the search path (#128).


# ggdist 3.1.0

New features and enhancements:

* The `stat_sample_...` and `stat_dist_...` families of stats have been merged (#83).
  * All `stat_dist_...` stats are deprecated in favor of their `stat_...` counterparts,
    which now understand the `dist`, `args`, and `arg1`...`arg9` aesthetics.
  * `xdist` and `ydist` can now be used in place of the `dist` aesthetic to
    specify the axis one is mapping a distribution onto (`dist` may be
    deprecated in the future).
  * Passing dist-like objects to the `x` or `y` aesthetics now raise a helpful
    error message suggesting you probably want to use `xdist` or `ydist`.
  * Restructured internals for stats and geoms makes it much easier to maintain
    shortcut geoms and stats, eliminating a large amount of code duplication (#106).
  * New `expand` parameter to `stat_slabinterval()` allows explicitly setting 
    whether or not the slab is expanded to the limits of the scale (rather than
    implicitly setting this based on `slab_type`).
* The `point_interval()` family of functions can now be passed `distributional`
  and `posterior::rvar()` objects, meaning that means and modes (in addition
  to medians) and highest-density intervals (in addition to quantile intervals)
  can now be visualized for analytical distributions.
  * As part of this, multivariate distribution objects and `rvar`s will generate
    a `.index` column when passed to `point_interval()` functions (#111).
    Based on a suggestion from @mitchelloharawild.
* New `stat_ribbon()` provided as a shortcut stat for `stat_lineribbon()` with
  no line (#48). Also, if you supply only an `x` or `y` aesthetic to
  `geom_lineribbon()`, you will get ribbons without a line (#127).
* One-sided intervals (i.e. quantiles) can now be calculated using `ul()` (upper
  limit) or `ll()` (lower limit), e.g. with `point_interval()` explicitly or
  via `mean_ll()`, `median_ll()`, `mode_ll()`, `mean_ul()`, `median_ul()`, 
  or `mode_ul()` (#49).
* Constant distributions are now reliably detected in a variety of situations
  and rendered as point masses in both density plots and histograms (#103, #32).
* Minor improvements and changes to dotplot layouts that may result in minor
  changes to the appearance of existing dotplots:
  * Minor improvements to automatic bin width selection; the maximum
    dot stack height should be closer to or equal to `scale` more often.
  * A formerly-internal fudge factor of `1.07` for dot sizes is now exposed as
    the default value of the `dotsize` parameter instead of being applied
    internally. This fudge factor tends (in my opinion) to make dotplots look a
    bit better due to the visual distance between circles, but is (I think) 
    better used as an explicit value than an implicit one, hence the change.
    This may create subtle changes to plots that use the `dotsize` or `stackratio` 
    parameters, but allows those parameters to have a more precise 
    geometric interpretation.

Documentation:

* New vignette for the `stat_dotsinterval()` sub-family: `vignette("dotsinterval")` (#120).
* Vastly improved and expanded documentation for the `stat_slabinterval()` and
  `geom_slabinterval()` family: each shortcut stat/geom now has its own documentation
  page that comprehensively lists all parameters, aesthetics, and computed variables,
  including those pulled in via `...` from typically-paired geoms. These docs are
  auto-generated and should be easy to maintain going forward. (#36)
* The `stat_lineribbon()` and `geom_lineribbon()` family now also has separate
  documentation pages with a comprehensive listing of aesthetics and parameters (#107).
* Ridge plot-like example in `vignette("slabinterval")` using the new `expand`
  parameter (#115).
  
Deprecations and removals:

* The `.prob` argument, a long-deprecated alias for `.width`, was removed.
* The `limits_function`, `limits_args`, `slab_function`, `slab_args`, `interval_function`,
  and `interval_args` arguments to `stat_slabinterval()` were removed: these were
  largely internal-use parameters only needed by subclasses of the base class for
  creating shortcut stats, yet added a lot of noise to the documentation, so these
  were replaced with the `$compute_limits()`, `$compute_slabs()`, and 
  `$compute_intervals()` methods on the new `AbstractStatSlabinterval` 
  internal base class.
  
Bug fixes:

* Improved handling of `NA`s for analytical distributions.
* Fixed bug where within-bin order of dots in dotplots for `"bin"` and `"weave"`
  layouts could be incorrect with aesthetics mapped at a sub-bin level.
* `stackratio`s that are not equal to `1` are now accounted for in 
  `find_dotplot_binwidth()` (i.e. automatic dotplot bin width selection).
* Ensure distinct fill colors in lineribbons are still treated as distinct for
  grouping even if the `fill_ramp` aesthetic ramps them to the same color.


# ggdist 3.0.1

Bug fixes:

* Forward-compatibility fixes for `distributional` >= 0.2.2.9000 (#91).
* Allow densities for samples of size 1 in `stat_sample_slabinterval()` (#98).
* Avoid NOTE about missing `linearGradient()` function on R < 4.1.
* Do not draw legend components for inactive sub-geoms in `geom_slabinterval()`.


# ggdist 3.0.0

Breaking changes:

* The positioning of `geom_slabinterval()` family geoms when using `position_dodge()`
  is now slightly different in order to match up with how other geoms are positioned (#85).
  This may slightly change existing charts that use `position = "dodge"`, and in
  some cases may cause slabs to be drawn slightly outside plot boundaries, but makes
  it much easier to combine `geom_slabinterval()` with other geoms in the expected
  way. If dodging more similar to the old approach is needed, use the new
  "justification-preserving dodge", `position_dodgejust()`, in place of `position_dodge()`.

New features:

* For `geom_slabinterval()`, `side`, `justification`, and `scale` can now be
  used as aesthetics instead of parameters, allowing them to vary across slabs
  within the same geom.
* Varying `fill`s within a slab  in `geom_slabinterval()` can now be drawn as
  true gradients rather than segmented polygons in R >= 4.1 by setting
  `fill_type = "gradient"`. This substantially improves the appearance of 
  gradient fills in graphics engines that support it (#44).
* Improved support for discrete distributions:
  * `stat_dist_slabinterval()` and company now detect discrete distributions and
    display them as histograms (#19).
  * `geom_dotsinterval()` now adjusts bin widths on discrete distributions when
    they would result in bins that are taller than the allocated space to ensure
    that they fit within the required space (#42).
* Allow user-specified lower and/or upper bounds on dynamic `geom_dotsinterval()`
  bin width by passing a vector of two values to the `binwidth` parameter.
* The automatic bin selection algorithm used by `geom_dotsinterval()` has been
  factored out and exported as `find_dotplot_binwidth()` and `bin_dots()` for
  others to use (#77).
* Previously, `curve_interval()` used a common (but naive) approach to finding
  a cutoff on data depth to identify the X% "deepest" curves, simply taking the
  envelope around the X% quantile of curves ranked by depth. This is quite
  conservative and tends to create intervals that are too wide; `curve_interval()`
  now searches for a cutoff in data depth such that X% of curves are contained
  within its envelope (#67).
* `point_interval()` and company now accept `distributional` objects and 
  `posterior::rvar()`s (full support for `distributional` objects requires
  `distributional` > 0.2.2).
* Reduce dependencies substantially, making the geoms more suitable for use by
  other packages (thanks to Brenton Wiernik for the help).

New documentation:

* Substantial improvements to the documentation of aesthetics and computed
  variables in `geom_slabinterval()`, `stat_slabinterval()`, and company, listing
  all custom aesthetics, computed variables, and their usage.

* Several new examples in `vignette("slabinterval")`, including "rain cloud" 
  plots and an example of histograms for discrete analytical distributions.

Bug fixes:

* Ensure `stat_dist_slabinterval()` preserves group order (#88).
* Improve test coverage up to ~96%.
* Restore computed variable `n` for `stat_sample_slabinterval()`.
* Various improvements in correct `NA` handling across the geoms (#74, #51).


# ggdist 2.4.1

New features:

* Added `"weave"` and `"swarm"` layouts for dots geoms (#64). These provide 
  alternative layouts that keep datapoints in their actual positions on the
  data axis. The `"weave"` layout maintains rows but not columns and works well 
  for quantile dotplots; the `"swarm"` layout uses the `"compactswarm"` method from 
  `beeswarm::beeswarm()` (courtesy James Trimble) and works well on sample data.
  See the dotplot section of `vignette("slabinterval")` for comparisons.
* Allow the use of `unit()` to specify bin widths manually for dots geoms and stats,
  which can be helpful when you need dotplots across facets to have the same bin width
  (#53).

New documentation:

* Add example of lineribbon gradients using `fill_ramp` in `vignette("lineribbon")`.
* Add example of Tukey-like pencils in `vignette("slabinterval")`.
* Add example of two slab used together (densities and dotplots to make "rain clouds")
  in `vignette("slabinterval")`.

Bug fixes:

* Fix issues with *ggplot2* 3.3.4 (#72) and *vdiffr* 1.0.
* Handle interactions between alpha and fill/color properly when not set by user (#62).
* Use step function for all ECDFs, which should also fix constant CDFs (#55).
* Move *fda* to suggests as it brings in a large number of dependencies and is rarely used.
* Use trimmed density for mode estimation (#57).


# ggdist 2.4.0

New features:

* add `pdf` and `cdf` computed variables for the `stat_sample_slabinterval()` subfamily. See
  new examples of usage in the last section of `vignette("slabinterval")`. (#11)
* add `cut_cdf_qi()` for creating (amongst other things) interval-filled halfeyes, in the 
  style of `bayesplot::mcmc_areas()` (#11)
* add `fill_ramp` and `color_ramp` scales to `geom_slabinterval()` and `geom_lineribbon()` families,
  making it easier to separate group colors from interval/density/CDF colors. See new examples in
  `vignette("slabinterval")`, `vignette("lineribbon")`, and `vignette("freq-uncertainty-vis")`. (#16)
* auto-detect finite limits on analytical distributions, so (e.g.) distributions like
  the beta will not cut off tails close to 0 or 1. (#18)
* add `brms::brmsprior` implementation for `parse_dist()` (#34)

New documentation:

* `vignette("freq-uncertainty-vis")` now uses `distributional::dist_student_t()` (#14)
* add references to *fuzzygrams* in `vignette("slabinterval")` (#23)
* add examples with separate positioning of slab and interval (#27)
* add discussion of limitations of curvewise intervals to `vignette("lineribbon")` (#22)
* soft-deprecate usage of `interval_size_range` argument in docs (#35)
* initial versions of some cheat sheets

Bug fixes:

* add limited `na.rm` support to `curve_interval()` (#22)
* use analytical instead of numerical derivatives on scale transformations where possible, improving reliability.


# ggdist 2.3.0

New features and documentation:

* Add `curve_interval()` for generating curvewise (joint) intervals for curve boxplots (#22)
* Add `vignette("lineribbon")` describing `geom_lineribbon()`, `stat_lineribbon()`,
  `stat_dist_lineribbon()`, and `curve_interval()`.

Bug fixes:

* Support `dist` aesthetics that are factors (#25)
* Fix slab drawing order for overlapping (ggridges-style) slabs (#30)
* Workaround for changes to {distributional} distribution functions until #31 is fixed.


# ggdist 2.2.0

* Support for [distributional](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/distributional/), including new
  examples in `vignette("slabinterval")` (#14).
* `stat_dist_...` geoms now calculate `pdf` and `cdf` columns to allow mashup geoms that involve both 
  functions, such as Correll-style gradient plots combined with violins, as in Helske *et al.* (#11).
* `stat_dist_...` geoms should now work with `gganimate` (#15).
* Examples updated to fix errors introduced by `broom::augment()` defaulting to `se_fit = FALSE`.


# ggdist 2.1.1

* Initial split from tidybayes: ggdist now contains all stats/geoms from tidybayes (except deprecated ones),
  all support functions for stats/geoms (such as `point_interval()`), `vignette("slabinterval")`, and
  `vignette("freq-uncertainty-vis")`. Tidybayes will retain all other functions, and will re-export all
  `ggdist` functions for now.
* All stats and geoms now support automatic orientation determination. Thus, all `h`-suffix geoms are now
  deprecated. Those geoms have been left in `tidybayes` and give a deprecation warning when used; they
  cannot be used from `ggdist` directly.
* `geom_interval()`, `geom_pointinterval()`, and `geom_lineribbon()` no longer automatically set the 
  `ymin` and `ymax` aesthetics if `.lower` or `.upper` are present in the data. This allows them to work
  better with automatic orientation detection (and was a bad feature to have existed in the first place
  anyway). The deprecated `tidybayes::geom_intervalh()` and `tidybayes::geom_pointintervalh()` still
  automatically set those aesthetics, since they are deprecated anyway (so supporting the old behavior
  is fine in these functions).
* `geom_lineribbon()`/`stat_lineribbon()` now supports a `step` argument for creating stepped lineribbons.
  H/T to Solomon Kurz for the suggestion.
* `ggdist` now has its own implementation of the scaled and shifted Student's t distribution (`dstudent_t()`,
  `qstudent_t()`, etc), since it is very useful for visualizing confidence distributions.
